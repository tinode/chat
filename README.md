# Tinode Instant Messaging Server

<img src="docs/logo.svg" align="left" width=128 height=128> Instant messaging full stack. Backend in pure [Go](http://golang.org) (license [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), clients for Android (Java), iOS (Swift), and web (ReactJS), as well as [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client support for C++, C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, etc (all clients licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). Wire transport is JSON over websocket (long polling is also available) or [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) with gRPC.

This is beta-quality software: feature-complete and stable but probably with a few bugs or missing features. Follow [instructions](INSTALL.md) to install and run or use one of the cloud services below. Read [API documentation](docs/API.md).

Tinode is *not* XMPP/Jabber. It is *not* compatible with XMPP. It's meant as a replacement for XMPP. On the surface, it's a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram.

## Why?

The promise of [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) was to deliver federated instant messaging: anyone would be able to spin up an IM server capable of exchanging messages with any other XMPP server in the world. Unfortunately, XMPP never delivered on this promise. Instant messengers are still a bunch of incompatible walled gardens, similar to what AoL of the late 1990s was to the open Internet.

The goal of this project is to deliver on XMPP's original vision: create a modern open platform for federated instant messaging with an emphasis on mobile communication. A secondary goal is to create a decentralized IM platform that is much harder to track and block by the governments.

An explicit NON-goal: we are not building yet another Slack replacement.

## Public service

A [public Tinode service](https://web.tinode.co/) is available. You can use it just like any other instant messenger. Keep in mind that demo accounts present in [sandbox](https://sandbox.tinode.co/) are not available in the public service. You must register an account using valid email in order to use the service.

### Web

TinodeWeb, a single page web app, is available at https://web.tinode.co/ ([source](https://github.com/tinode/webapp/)). See screenshots below.

### Android

[Tinode for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx) a.k.a Tindroid is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid)). See the screenshots below. A [debug APK](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid/releases/latest) is also provided for convenience.

### iOS

[Tinode for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538) a.k.a. Tinodios is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/ios)). See the screenshots below.


## Demo/Sandbox

A sandboxed demo service is available at https://sandbox.tinode.co/.

Log in as one of `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`, `frank`. Password is `<login>123`, e.g. login for `alice` is `alice123`. You can discover other users by email or phone by prefixing them with `email:` or `tel:` respectively. Emails are `<login>@example.com`, e.g. `alice@example.com`, phones are `+17025550001` through `+17025550009`.

When you register a new account you are asked for an email address to send validation code to. For demo purposes you may use `123456` as a universal validation code. The code you get in the email is also valid.

### Sandbox Notes

* The sandbox server is reset (all data wiped) every night at 3:15am Pacific time. An error message `User not found or offline` means the server was reset while you were connected. If you see it on the web, reload and relogin. On Android log out and re-login. If the database was changed, delete the app then reinstall.
* Sandbox user `Tino` is a [basic chatbot](./chatbot) which responds with a [random quote](http://fortunes.cat-v.org/) to any message.
* As generally accepted, when you register a new account you are asked for an email address. The server will send an email with a verification code to that address and you can use it to validate the account. To make things easier for testing, the server will also accept `123456` as a verification code. Remove line `"debug_response": "123456"` from `tinode.conf` to disable this option.
* The sandbox server is configured to use [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS [implementation](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme) with hard-coded requirement for [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). If you are unable to connect then the most likely reason is your TLS client's missing support for SNI. Use a different client.
* The default web app loads a single minified javascript bundle and minified CSS. The un-minified version is also available at https://sandbox.tinode.co/index-dev.html
* [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/tinode/) with the same demo are available.
* You are welcome to test your client software against the sandbox, hack it, etc. No DDoS-ing though please.
